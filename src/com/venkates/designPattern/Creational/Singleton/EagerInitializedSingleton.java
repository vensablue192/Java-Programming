/*
 * In eager initialization, the instance of the singleton class is created at the time of class loading. 
 * The drawback to eager initialization is that the method is created even though the client application might not be using it.
 * If your singleton class is not using a lot of resources, this is the approach to use. 
 * But in most of the scenarios, singleton classes are created for resources such as File System, 
 * Database connections, etc. We should avoid the instantiation unless the client calls the getInstance method. 
 * Also, this method doesnâ€™t provide any options for exception handling
