/*
 * Prior to Java 5, the Java memory model had a lot of issues, and the previous approaches used to fail in certain scenarios where too many threads tried to
 * get the instance of the singleton class simultaneously. So Bill Pugh came up  with a different approach to create the singleton class using an inner static
 * helper class. Notice the private inner static class that contains the instance of the singleton class. When the singleton class is loaded, 
 * SingletonHelper class is not loaded into memory and only when someone calls the getInstance() method, this class gets loaded and creates the singleton class instance.
 *  This is the most widely used approach for the singleton class as it doesnâ€™t require synchronization.
